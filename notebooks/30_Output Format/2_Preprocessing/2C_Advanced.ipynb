This surge was primarily driven by heightened consumer demand for iPhones in the United States. In response to newly imposed tariffs of up to 104% on Chinese imports by the U.S. government, Apple expedited shipments of iPhones to the U.S. to mitigate potential price hikes. Analysts projected that the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB could increase by $350 (29%) to $1,549 due to these tariffs. Consequently, consumers rushed to purchase iPhones before the anticipated price increases took effect, leading to a substantial boost in sales and positively impacting Apple's stock performance.\"},\n",

This decision was part of broader efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. The closure of retail stores was expected to significantly impact Apple's revenue, as customers would be unable to experience and purchase products in person. Additionally, the pandemic led to reduced consumer demand and supply chain disruptions, further affecting Apple's operations.

The stimulus plan included direct payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment benefits, and financial support for businesses, which collectively bolstered market confidence.

       "      <td id=\"T_d3ff4_row0_col6\" class=\"data row0 col6\" >On April 9, 2025, Apple Inc. experienced a significant stock price increase of 15.33%. This surge was primarily driven by heightened consumer demand for iPhones in the United States. In response to newly imposed tariffs of up to 104% on Chinese imports by the U.S. government, Apple expedited shipments of iPhones to the U.S. to mitigate potential price hikes. Analysts projected that the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB could increase by $350 (29%) to $1,549 due to these tariffs. Consequently, consumers rushed to purchase iPhones before the anticipated price increases took effect, leading to a substantial boost in sales and positively impacting Apple's stock performance.</td>\n",

This decision was part of broader efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. The closure of retail stores was expected to significantly impact Apple's revenue, as customers would be unable to experience and purchase products in person. Additionally, the pandemic led to reduced consumer demand and supply chain disruptions, further affecting Apple's operations. These factors contributed to a sharp decline in investor confidence, resulting in a 12.86% drop in Apple's stock price on that day.</td>\n",

Secondly, the company announced that its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) would be held as an online event in June, demonstrating adaptability amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the broader market was rebounding from previous sell-offs, contributing to the positive momentum in Apple's stock price.</td>\n",

The stimulus plan included direct payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment benefits, and financial support for businesses, which collectively bolstered market confidence. As a result, major indices like the Dow Jones and S&P 500 experienced significant gains, and Apple's market capitalization rebounded above the $1 trillion mark.</td>\n",
