AAPL,2025-04-09,15.33,Apple's Stock Surges Amid Tariff-Induced Consumer Rush,https://www.axios.com/2025/04/09/apple-stock-tariffs-china-iphones,Axios,"On April 9, 2025, Apple Inc. experienced a significant stock price increase of 15.33%. This surge was primarily driven by heightened consumer demand for iPhones in the United States. In response to newly imposed tariffs of up to 104% on Chinese imports by the U.S. government, Apple expedited shipments of iPhones to the U.S. to mitigate potential price hikes. Analysts projected that the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB could increase by $350 (29%) to $1,549 due to these tariffs. Consequently, consumers rushed to purchase iPhones before the anticipated price increases took effect, leading to a substantial boost in sales and positively impacting Apple's stock performance."

Additionally, the pandemic led to reduced consumer demand and supply chain disruptions, further affecting Apple's operations. These factors contributed to a sharp decline in investor confidence, resulting in a 12.86% drop in Apple's stock price on that day."
