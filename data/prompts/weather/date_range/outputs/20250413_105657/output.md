I'm unable to provide real-time or future weather forecasts or URLs, as I don't have browsing capabilities. However, you can find the weather forecast for Madrid for the dates you specified (April 13–20, 2025) on reputable weather websites closer to the date. Here are some websites where you can search for extended weather forecasts:

1. https://www.accuweather.com/
2. https://www.weather.com/ (The Weather Channel)
3. https://www.meteoblue.com/
4. https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/ (more UK-focused but has international forecasts)
5. https://www.eltiempo.es/ (Spanish weather site)

Once you're closer to the forecast window (usually within 7 to 10 days), search Madrid on one of these sites and navigate to the “10-day forecast” section.

For example, to check the 10-day weather for Madrid on AccuWeather, you’ll eventually be able to visit:
