I'm unable to browse the internet or provide real-time or future dynamic content such as live weather forecasts. However, you can find the weather forecast for Madrid from April 13 to April 20, 2025, by visiting a reliable weather website and searching for the city's forecast on those dates.

Here are some trustworthy sources where you can check extended weather forecasts:

1. https://weather.com (The Weather Channel)
2. https://www.accuweather.com
3. https://www.metoffice.gov.uk
4. https://www.wunderground.com
5. https://www.eltiempo.es (for Spain-specific forecasts)

To find the forecast:

- Go to one of the above websites.
- Enter "Madrid" in the search bar.
- Navigate to the extended or 10-day forecast to view weather details for April 13â€“20, 2025.

For example, on Weather.com, the URL might look like this once the forecast is available:
https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/Madrid+Spain

Please note that forecasts for dates that far in advance may not be published until closer to April 2025.
